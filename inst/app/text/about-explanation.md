## Welcome to the Models of Care evidence map (Release 1)

There are many strategies and interventions that have been developed over the years aimed at reducing the need for or otherwise avoiding unnecessary acute hospital admission or attendance. The sheer breadth of approaches and inconsistent nomenclature makes comparison difficult. Evidence synthesis simply isnâ€™t feasible. However, it is possible to map important findings from research and evaluation which may help to inform modelling assumptions in local health systems.

An evidence map provides an easy-to-use overview of relevant evidence. This map is interactive, enabling you to explore evidence using a range of parameters, including mechanisms to manage capacity/demand and outcome measures.  This overview of evidence can be particularly helpful for spotting gaps in the evidence base, which might generate questions to explore via engagement, analysis, evaluation and research.

For this first iteration of the map, we have focused on quantitative evidence on initiatives which aim to reduce hospital activity (specifically: admissions, readmissions, length of stay, A&E attendances and outpatient attendances) to support demand and capacity planning. For the most part, we have focused on evidence of system-level initiatives for scalability. 
It is important to consider a range of evidence in planning, including qualitative evidence on acceptability, cost effectiveness, patient/staff experience and implementation. We expect to broaden the scope of the map in future releases, including exploring factors influencing hospital demand.  

We have categorised evidence according to six different mechanisms which are described in the taxonomy.  We have also categorised evidence according to the setting; evidence type (primary/secondary); outcomes and overall effect. The taxonomy describes these categories in detail.
